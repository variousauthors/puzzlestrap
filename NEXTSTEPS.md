NEXTSTEPS
---------

 - user should be able to upload multiple images, with each representing a layer
   - some colour should be used as transparency? Or maybe PNG will let us do that?
   - be able to delete an image and remove it from the puzzle
   - supporting identical tiles on different layers means we'll have to use a hash
     that includes the layer, or the image file used
   - be able to insert images between other images
   - show the player layer, so that the user can upload an image above, below, or colliding with the player layer
   - one image per layer, for now

 - a GUI
   - image upload tool
   - tile preview tab, with name fields and all data
   - prelude tab with prelude fields and some radios/checkboxes (just checkboxes to begin with)

 - add a dummy player object (a red square) 
   - this way the user can explore their map as soon as they are in the puzzlescript editor

 - be able to name tiles?
   - show all the tiles in a preview mode with name fields that update the name
